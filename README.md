# Akash Akter's Personal Portfolio

## üëã Introduction

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website!

This is a place to showcase my journey as a **Full-Stack Developer**. I'm passionate about building scalable, performant web applications with intuitive user experiences. My expertise lies in the **React** ecosystem, particularly with **Next.js** for front-end and **Node.js/Express** for back-end development.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me solving challenges on LeetCode, exploring new technologies, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code.

## üéì Research & Publications

I have co-authored a peer-reviewed paper focused on mobile security.

**Classification of Malicious Financial Applications Using Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithms Based on Android Permission**

-   **Conference:** 3rd Intl. Conference on Advancement in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (ICAEEE 2024)
-   **Publisher:** IEEE
-   **DOI:** `10.1109/ICAEEE62219.2024.10561780`
-   **Abstract:** Investigated vulnerabilities in Android financial apps through permission analysis. We created a dataset of 12,050 samples and used K-Nearest Neighbor ($88.25\%$ accuracy) and Naive Bayes ($82.07\%$ accuracy) to detect malicious apps, providing a framework for enhanced mobile banking security.
